# Churn Data Exploration

## Project Overview

This project is based on a project from my graduate program and altered in order to add to my public portfolio.  This serves as an early example of my abilities as a reference to see how I have grown as a data scientist.  The data used in this dataset is available in this repository.  It is the version cleaned during the project available in the "churn_data_cleaning" repository, which used data from [here](https://community.ibm.com/accelerators/catalog/content/Telco-customer-churn).

In this project I have perfomed a hypothesis test to determine if the amount a customer is billed might influence whether they choose to terminate services.  I also preformed univariate and bivariate analysis on two categorical and two continuous variables.
